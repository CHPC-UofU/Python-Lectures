\section*{Introduction}
In this document we describe the access to the JupyterHub clusters
that will be used during the lectures.

\section{Setting up an account on the JupyterHub servers}
People who have a UoU account can log into the \href{https://juno.chpc.utah.edu/}{https://juno.chpc.utah.edu/}
cluster using their UoU credentials. The \texttt{juno} cluster will be persistent during and after the lectures.

People who do \textbf{NOT} have a UoU account can use the JupyterHub server 
\href{https://pythonclass.chpc.utah.edu/}{https://pythonclass.chpc.utah.edu/}.
We suggest to the users of the \texttt{pythonclass} server to select a \textbf{valid} 
email address as his/her username. The choice of a password is optional. 
There are a few restrictions to the use of the \texttt{pythonclass} cluster:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the \texttt{pythonclass} server is only online during the actual class time.
\item do \textbf{NOT} store files on the server that you would rather keep private.
\item at the end of the $2$-week lecture cycle all your class files will be compressed and sent to the 
(valid) email address/user name.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Alternatives to the JupyterHub Servers}
If you are using the \texttt{pythonclass} server and would like to tinker with Python after class time 
we strongly recommend to install 
a recent \href{https://www.anaconda.com/download/}{Anaconda3 distribution} on your laptop.
The installation requirements are described in the document 
\href{https://github.com/CHPC-UofU/python-lectures/tree/master/docs/laptop.pdf}{laptop.pdf}

\section*{Acknowledgement}
We want to thank Luan Truong to set up the \texttt{juno} and \texttt{pythonclass} clusters.
